DESCRIPTION:
------------

This directory contains a pretty much empty RabbitMQ plugin.  It
should work with RabbitMQ brokers in the 2.3.x to 2.4.x version range,
at a minimum.

I whipped it up as a placeholder since the plugin authoring guide on
the RabbitMQ web site is now a bit out of date, and the sample
discussed there, the metronome plugin, doesn't work with current
Rabbits.  The guide and the example should be updated in the
relatively near future, but until then, they have a chance of
confusing someone trying to work with them.

With questions or comments, please bug:

     jerrykuch VIA gmail.com

Or:

     jerry VIA rabbitmq.com

Good luck!
